# Planner-Homework
    For this homework our task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. we were given a basic html and css to work with at the very start and has to add in the planner layout itself and program it with the javascript.

## What it needed to have
    The planner needed to have the current time and day  displayed, all of the time blocks needed to have an hour for every hour in a business day.The time blocks needed to be color coded so when the time has passed the backgrounds will change color. It also needed to have a button that saved user inputs to local storage. and save it once it refreshes.

## what I did
    for this assignment, I started out by taking some cards from bootstrap and duplicating them for the amount of hours I needed. That is how i made the actual planner. then I added some classes and some Id's to the div containers to program with my js. In the Js, I set a function to automatically update the time of day, and the day itself.then i needed to create a cas function to my timeslots, and last but not least, i needed to save them to local storage.
